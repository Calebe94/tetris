# üéÆ Tetris üöÄ

This project is a classic implementation of the popular game Tetris, written in C++ using the SDL2 library. Tetris is a puzzle game where players manipulate falling blocks called "tetrominos" to create complete lines on the game board. When a line is completed, it clears from the board, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominos reaches the top of the game board.

The main objective of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play the timeless game of Tetris, while also serving as a practical example of using the SDL2 library for game development in C++.

## How to Play

1. **Compile the Game:**

```sh
make all
```

2. **Run the Game:**

```sh
./bin/tetris
```

3. **Controls:**
    - **Left Arrow:** Move tetromino left
    - **Right Arrow:** Move tetromino right
    - **Down Arrow:** Soft drop tetromino
    - **Up Arrow or Space:** Rotate tetromino
    - **P:** Pause the game
